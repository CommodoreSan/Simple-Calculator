# Simple-Calculator
A simple calculaor with GUI made in java

This was made as part of my 3rd Semester project in Object Oriented Programming. So far, it has textbox inputs for operator, operands and the result, and
a button to do the calculation. The commented parts of the code originally displayed the output in a popup but I could not figure out how to close the popups,
that is why the output now appears in a textbox instead. I hope to change the text input to button input and then try to add trigonometric functions to this.
